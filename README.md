# Niceout

Niceout is just a simple command line based weather tool written in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/).

## Usage

To use, you will need to get an [OpenWeatherMap key](https://openweathermap.org/api) and set an ENV variable of `OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_KEY` with the value.

Run the code directly:
```
crystal src/niceout.cr
```

or build and execute
```
crystal build src/niceout.cr --release
./niceout
```
